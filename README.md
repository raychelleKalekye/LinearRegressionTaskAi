# LinearRegressionTaskAi
You are expected to use the provided Nairobi Office Price Ex dataset with One feature ùë• (office size) and one target (office price). ùë¶ Write two python functions one for computing Mean Squared Error to be used as your Performance Measure Technique and another for Gradient Descent as your learning algorithm that can update weights (refer to class theory notes on this formulas) Set random initial values for slope (m) and y-intercept (c) and train an intelligent linear regression model of your dataset for 10 epochs by calling the above functions. Show the error in every epoch. Also plot the line of best fit after the final epoch. Use your above learnt line to predict the office price when the size is 100 sq. ft.
